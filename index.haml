    %h2 About LevelUp

    %p
      LevelUp is a series of classes, and conferences for University students
      who want to add to their classroom learning with real-world experience.
      Topics range from test-driven development, continuous delivery, and pair
      programming to agile project management, business analysis, and how
      employers hire grads.

    %p
      LevelUp conferences are single day events, and LevelUp courses run 6-9
      weeks, one day a week.
      %strong
        %em
          Every LevelUp event is free. Forever.
