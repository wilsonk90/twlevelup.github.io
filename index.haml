      I registered for LevelUp but life got complicated and I can no longer attend, what do I do?

      "I came into LevelUp having done a lot of programming but no experience with delivering software. I'd heard of Agile, but had no idea what it involved. After completing the first LevelUp, an interviewer told me I'd given a better run-down of Agile methodologies than developers who'd spent ten years doing it."
