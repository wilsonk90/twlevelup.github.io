        Over 6 weeks, you'll deliver a project from start to finish, guided by a team of ThoughtWorks consultants. We'll teach you everything you need to know along the way, from Agile planning and design to writing and testing your own code. You won't just walk away with working software for your portfolio - you'll have knowledge, skills and experience to hit the ground running in the workplace.

    <h2>Course Information</h2>
    <div class='border-line'></div>
    <div class='questions'>
      <div class='question'>
        What am I going to learn?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        This course is designed to bridge the gap between university and you're first full time job in
        You'll experience real world
        <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development'>Agile software development</a>
        first-hand. You'll learn all about inceptions, standups, story writing, continuous delivery, test automation, pairing, test-driven development, retrospectives and more.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        How?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        When you start the course you will meet your team, product owners and come up with a concept for a video game. From then on you will work with your team to deliver a game. The LevelUp team will offer guidance and hands-on support to help you get your software across the line. Make no mistake though, it's you who will be getting the job done!
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        When is it?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        The kickoff day is on the 22nd March and filled with games, workshops and group work. Then, we meet weekly from the
        <strong>24th,</strong>
        every
        <strong>Monday night</strong>
        from 6pm till 9pm.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What are the different roles?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Everyone is going to be involved in design, taking ownership, overall quality. You will have to collaborate on
        <strong>all</strong>
        aspects of the project to ensure a kick-ass game!
        <ul id='selector'>
          <li>Business analysts - work closely with product owners to capture requirements and figure out the details.</li>
          <li>Developers - will build the game.</li>
          <li>Testers - help ensure the overall quality of the product, and provide feedback to developers and business analysts.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What happens when I pick a role - am I stuck with it?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        In order to ensure balanced teams, we need people to stick with their role. However, because this is an agile team, just because you're a developer doesn't mean you'll be writing code all the time.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        What do I need to bring?
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        Developers
        <strong>must</strong>
        bring their own laptop. Food and drinks will be provided. If you're not a developer, a laptop is useful but not essential.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>
        But I don't know anything about video games.
      </div>
      <div class='answer'>
        I'm sure you have some awesome ideas though.
      </div>
      <div class='question'>Am I guaranteed a spot if I register?</div>
      <div class='answer'>To make this the best experience we can we need cross functional teams with the right combination of people in each role (developer, business analyst and tester). Whilst the LevelUp team would love to accept everyone, places are limited.</div>
